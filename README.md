Introduction

******

 Scikit-learn is a very popular Python library for Machine Learning. Initially developed by David Cournapeau in 2007, it began to grow up in 2010, when INRIA, the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation got involved into the project. In September 2021, the latest release of Scikit-learn was released, i.e. 1.0.

Scikit-learn provides all the steps involved in the Machine Learning process, including Data Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Model Selection, Model Training, Model Evaluation and Model Deployment.

Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python.

It is licensed under a permissive simplified BSD license and is distributed under many Linux distributions, encouraging academic and commercial use.

The library is built upon the SciPy (Scientific Python) that must be installed before you can use scikit-learn.

## The learning outcome will fall into few categories and I will demonstrate these three interesting scikit-learn algorithms

- Classification

- Regression

- t-Test

- One-Way Anova
