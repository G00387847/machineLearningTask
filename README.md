# Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and other relevant files demonstrating my work on the Python packages `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `sklearn` for module machine learning and statistics



 ## Install


 steps to install....

To run these notebook on your own notebook server, use these installation instructions. The instructions below will install everything you need and then start a Jupyter notebook

1.  Install Anaconda from [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/), choose 64-bit Python 3.7 or higher.
Note: if you already have Anaconda installed, you can keep using it but it should be version 4.4.10 or later (as shown by: Anaconda -V). If you have a previous version installed, you can update it using the command. 
2. Get more stuff.
3. Run commands.

## Run

Here's how to run the project/notebooks:

1. open terminal
2. Run Jupyter with scikit-learn and scipy-stats
3. Go to browser

## Explore


Looking  at the two ntebooks in this repository in Jupyter. There is some interesting aspects:

- The notebook `plots.ipynb` has different types of plot as example. You can edit the parameters of the plots to see different effects.

- change the following code and see how the plot changes:

```python

def f(x):
   return x * x
```
